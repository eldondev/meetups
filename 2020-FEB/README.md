## This Month in Kubernetes

- Work has begun on a [containerd implementation using firecracker microVM manager](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd), Amazon's lightweight VMM,
  incorporating hypervisor capabilities as an additional security feature for workload isolation. Similar work
	has been done with rkt (now likely mothballed), and active projects including gVisor from google, and kata containers from openstack.

- With the release of 1.17 and release processes starting to roll for 1.18, many projects and platforms are deprecating support for earlier version.
	Knative: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/v0.12.1
	Azure: https://github.com/Azure/AKS/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
  This is awkward, due to the fact that Amazon's EKS, a significant player in the space, hasn't yet released 1.15
